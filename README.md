# GCR_DataScraping
It's an automation project that was done using UiPath for my course RoboticProcessAutomation. 
This project aims to bring all your assignments, projects and all the tasks that was assigned to you by the teachers via GoogleClassroom. With a single click all your tasks are scraped and put into a local to_do.txt file in desktop.
